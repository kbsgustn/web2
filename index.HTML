  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web,
     is an information system where documents and other web resources are
     identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such as https://www.example.com/),
     which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are accessible over the Internet.[1]
     The resources of the WWW are transfered via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
     and may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser and are
     published by a software application called a web server.
